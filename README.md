# Shooter-Game
A simple shooter game made in python, using Ursina game-engine.


Note: You'll need Python 3.11 and Ursina game-engine.

Where to get Python:
Microsoft Store -> Search 'Python' (Recommended)

Official site -> https://www.python.org/downloads/

Where to get Ursina:
cmd -> pip install ursina (recommended) Note: (use this command after you install Python 3.11)

Official site -> https://www.ursinaengine.org/installation.html

To run the game, download all the files in the same folder and run 'main.py'.

Controls:
- W, A, S, D - movement

- Left mouse button - shoot

- Right mouse button - punch the enemies and push them back

- B - Buy Ammo

- H - Buy Health

- Space - Restart When you die


Optional (For Dev testing):
P - Pause

O - Resume after Pausing - Note: Wait a few seconds after resuming! The enemies need to respawn!


I'll add more features in future updates. The current version is 0.5.

Release notes so far:

0.01 - Imported Ursina game-engine

0.1 - Added a character with 3rd person view, created a platform

0.2 - Added textures, score and ammo, walls

0.3 - Added enemies which spawn randomly, fixed bugs

0.4 - Added model to enemies, switched to 1st person view

0.5 - Added enemy movement, sounds, health and dead mechanics; Now enemies give damage to you



What I want to add:

-More enemy textures

-More Maps

-Game Modes Time Attack (how many kills in 5 minutes?), Best Score (the best score made in 5 minutes), free-play (classic) 

-A "pre-game" interface where you can see the controls, volume options, change textures for the enemies or map, choose game mode, start the game, etc.

-Local Multiplayer


@This game is open-source. If you want to modify it, go ahead! I would be glad if you're interested in this little project! :)
